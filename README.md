# PWLottie

PWLottie is a QML Lottie animation player based on Samsung [rlottie](https://github.com/Samsung/rlottie) library and [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) framework.

PWLottie provides additional functional for creating controllers to support optimiziation of a big amount of lottie animations loaded at the same time. This feature can support optimization in application but it is extremely important to remember to optimize the user interface in other aspects.
The project presents two examples, the first example is a basic example of a controller that stores the number of registered lottie animations and sets their FPS depending on their number and the second just empty example that inherited from abstract controller.
